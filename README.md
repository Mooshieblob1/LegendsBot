# LegendsBot

LegendsBot is an experimental project for SAE students to make a bot that serves the needs of a university student. It's designed to be easy to understand, even for those new to programming. This document provides an overview of the project structure, setup, and execution process.

## Project Structure

A typical Python project structure is used:

-   **`venv/`** (or similar, e.g., `.venv/`): This directory contains the Python virtual environment, including the interpreter and installed packages for the project. This isolates project dependencies. This folder is usually not committed to version control (see `.gitignore`).
-   **`commands/`** (or `cogs/` if using a library like `discord.py`): This directory holds the Python files for each of the bot's slash commands or application commands. Each file typically defines a command's name, description, options, and the logic to execute when the command is invoked.
    -   **`add.py`**: This file contains the code for an `/add` command. Imagine you want the bot to remember something, like a task for a to-do list or an event for a calendar. This file tells the bot how to understand and process the "add" instruction from a user.
    -   **`list.py`**: This file powers a `/list` command. If you've asked the bot to remember several things (using the `/add` command, for example), this command would be used to show you everything it has stored. It's responsible for fetching and neatly presenting this information back to the user.
    -   **`remove.py`**: This file defines a `/remove` command. This command allows users to tell the bot to forget something it previously stored, such as removing a task from a to-do list or an event from a calendar. It handles the logic for finding and deleting the specified item.
-   **`requirements.txt`** (or `pyproject.toml` if using Poetry/PDM): This file lists the project's dependencies.
    -   `requirements.txt`: A simple text file listing packages and their versions, typically managed with `pip`.
    -   `pyproject.toml`: Used by modern Python packaging tools like Poetry or PDM. It contains metadata such as project name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and development dependencies. It can also define scripts.
-   **`poetry.lock`** or **`pdm.lock`** (if using Poetry or PDM): This file is automatically generated and records the exact versions of all installed dependencies and their sub-dependencies, ensuring consistent environments. If using `pip` with `requirements.txt`, versions can be "pinned" in `requirements.txt` for similar consistency.
-   **Python files (e.g., `main.py`, `bot.py`, `deploy_commands.py`, `config.py`)**: These files in the root directory or a dedicated source directory (e.g., `src/`) typically handle the main application logic.
    -   `main.py` or `bot.py`: Think of this as the main brain or the starting engine of your bot. When you tell your computer to run the bot, this is the first file it looks at. It's responsible for crucial tasks like connecting the bot to Discord (logging in using a library like `discord.py` or `hikari`), loading all the different commands from the `commands/` or `cogs/` folder, and setting up how the bot listens and responds to events.
    -   `deploy_commands.py` (or integrated into `main.py`/`bot.py`): This is a helper script or part of the main script. Discord bots use "slash commands" (or application commands). Before users can use these commands, Discord needs to know that your bot offers them. This script (or logic) takes all the command definitions and registers them with Discord. You usually only need to run this script (or ensure this part of your code runs) when you add new commands or make significant changes to existing ones.
    -   `config.py` (or similar): Often used to store configuration variables like the bot token or client ID, though sensitive information should ideally be in `.env`.
-   **`.env`**: This file (if used) stores environment-specific configuration variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials). It should **not** be committed to version control for security reasons. Use a `.env.example` file as a template.
-   **`.gitignore`**: This file tells Git which files or folders to ignore and not track. Common entries include `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, and OS-specific files.
-   **`README.md`**: This file! It provides information about the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (e.g., v3.8 or newer)
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer, usually comes with Python)
    -   Optionally, a package manager like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) or [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/getting-started/installation/).
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Optional, but recommended for an easier experience with Python extensions)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (VS Code uses your system's Git installation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**

    *   **Option 1: Using the command line**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Mooshieblob1/LegendsBot # Replace with your Python bot's repository URL
        cd LegendsBot
        ```
    *   **Option 2: Using Visual Studio Code**
        1.  Open VS Code.
        2.  If you see the "Welcome" page, click on "Clone Git Repository...".
        3.  If you don't see the "Welcome" page, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
        4.  Type `Git: Clone` and select it from the list.
        5.  Paste your repository URL into the prompt and press Enter.
        6.  Choose a local directory where you want to save the project.
        7.  Once cloned, VS Code will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Click "Open".

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *Tip: VS Code can often help manage virtual environments.*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will read the `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`) file and install all the necessary project dependencies into your virtual environment.
    *   **Using pip:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Using Poetry:**
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
    *   **Using PDM:**
        ```bash
        pdm install
        ```
    *Tip: You can open a terminal directly in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal or `Ctrl+\``).*

4.  **Set up environment variables (if applicable):**
    If the project uses a `.env.example` file, copy it to `.env` and fill in your specific configuration details (e.g., API keys, database URLs). The content for the `.env` file can be found as a pinned message in the SAE Legends Discord channel #uni-legends-bot.
    ```bash
    # If .env.example exists
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open `.env` in a text editor and add your environment-specific values.

## Running the Project

Python is an interpreted language. The Python files are run directly by the Python interpreter.
To run the bot (after activating the virtual environment and setting up `.env`):
